The Scanner class can be found in the java.util package. It is used to get user input from the command line. 
Scanner can read and save primitive data types as well as Strings.

To use the Scanner class, create an object of the class and use any of the available methods found in the Scanner class documentation.
In our example, we will use the nextLine() method, which is used to read Strings:

  import java.util.Scanner;  // Import the Scanner class
  
  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);  // Create a Scanner object
      System.out.println("Enter username");
  
      String userName = myObj.nextLine();  // Read user input
      System.out.println("Username is: " + userName);  // Output user input
    }
  }

Input Types:

nextBoolean()	  Reads a boolean value from the user
nextByte()	  Reads a byte value from the user
nextDouble()	  Reads a double value from the user
nextFloat()	  Reads a float value from the user
nextInt()	  Reads a int value from the user
nextLine()	  Reads a String value from the user
nextLong()	  Reads a long value from the user
nextShort()	  Reads a short value from the user

Example:
  Note: If you enter wrong input (e.g. text in a numerical input), you will get an exception/error message (like "InputMismatchException").

  import java.util.Scanner;
  
  class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner myObj = new Scanner(System.in);
  
      System.out.println("Enter name, age and salary:");
  
      // String input
      String name = myObj.nextLine();
  
      // Numerical input
      int age = myObj.nextInt();
      double salary = myObj.nextDouble();
  
      // Output input by user
      System.out.println("Name: " + name);
      System.out.println("Age: " + age);
      System.out.println("Salary: " + salary);
    }
  }

Note: When scanning anything other than nextLine(), it might be wise to clear the scanner's "buffer" by writing this in your code:

[Scanner object].nextLine();

This will scan all the way to the end of the line and create a new line for the user to input properly. 
Not doing this might cause an error, as the scanner has not left the line that they previously scans and thus might scan the previous line again.
